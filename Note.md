### Data Model
Account (3) -> Price Plan (3) -> Contact (5) -> Reading

### Initial the project
1. clone the repo to local system
```
git clone https://github.com/sf-wilson/joyofenergy-apex.git
```
2. dev branch mgmt (need web auth)
```
# new a branch
git branch dev

# push the code from local system to dev branch
git push origin dev

# switch the branch
git checkout dev

# check all the branch on the repo
git branch
```
3. check the metadata structure and modify the package.xml for deploying to org
    - ApexClass
    - LightningComponentBundle
    - CustomObject
    - QuickAction

### Extra Setup in SFDC
1. create an app and tabs for the custom part
    - tabs
        * Price Plans
        * Readings
    - app
        * JOI Energy
2. assign FLS for system admin via profile

    - Contact
3. import sample data
4. adjust page layout
    - Price Plan
    - Reading
    - Account - Account Layout
    - Account - Contact Layout (also need to add quick action: FetchMockData)
5. go to the one of the contact record, then click the FetchMockData button, then reading records will be initialized.
```
select id,Client__r.name,Name, format(ReadingTime__c), Value__c from Reading__c order by ReadingTime__c desc
```
6. adjust test code to solve the assert errors in `UsageStubTest`
7. develop recommendPlans lwc & also need to add @AuraEnabled for property & method
8. add the component to contact record page

### Run Code in your Scratch Org
1. dev hub -> enable dev hub
2. push source to scratch org
3. import sample data
4. add component to contact record page

### Common CLI
```
# set alias
sfdx force:alias:set sp21=wilson@releasesp21.com

# import data
sfdx force:data:tree:import -f data/Account.json -u sp21
sfdx force:data:tree:import -f data/Account.json -u joyofenergyapex

# push code to dev
git status # check changed files
git add . # add all new or changed files
git commit -m "your commit"

### ToDo
1. trial the ref1, 3
2. optimize data import -> just like dreamhouse
3. optimize fetchreading records - refresh to display the reading records after clicing the quick action button

### Bug
1. click quick action
	insert reading
	-> refresh recommend data
2. edit / delete reading
	- refresh recommend data

communicate data across components:
1. components with hierarchy -> custom event

2. components without hierarchy -> Pub-Sub Model

3. platform event

Lightning message service vs platform events vs pubsub

As of July 2020, c/pubsub has been superseded by the Lightning Message Service.


1. apexrefresh with wire
2. optimize the import data process, and if partial success, how it does.

#### Implementing Comparable
Apex will not let you use the built in sort method for List to sort sObjects by a field inside. To do this, we have to implement our own comparable class to do the sorting for us.
